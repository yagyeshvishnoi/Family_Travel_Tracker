To create a README file for the provided code, we need to first understand the contents and purpose of the code in the uploaded ZIP file. I'll start by extracting the ZIP file to review its contents. This will help in drafting a README that accurately describes the logic behind the code and how to interact with it. Let's proceed with extracting and reviewing the contents of the ZIP file.

The Family_Travel_Tracker-main directory contains several files and directories essential for understanding the project's structure and purpose. Here's a summary of the contents:

- .gitignore: A file specifying intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- index.js: Likely the entry point of the application.
- package-lock.json & package.json: These files are used by npm to handle project dependencies.
- public: A directory typically used for static files like HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript.
- queries.sql: Contains SQL queries, possibly for database interaction.
- solution.js: Could be additional logic or a specific solution part of the project.
- views: A directory, usually containing template files for rendering the UI.
